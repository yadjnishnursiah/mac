        <h1 class="display-3">Eat' Cupcakes!</h1>
        <p><font color="brown">I started Eat' Cupcakes in 2011 as a personal blog and an easy way to share my baking recipes with my friends and family. At the time, I felt a little lost in both my career and life, but the kitchen always kept me centered. My small hobby blog quickly ignited a passion for food photography and teaching others how to bake, not just what to bake.

            Just a year and a half after launching my blog, I quit my full-time job to build Eat' Cupcakes into a business. Since then, I’ve written, photographed, and, went on a 20-city national book tour, and hired 2 assistants, Aiushtha and Pedro, to help me manage my business. I’m so grateful this has been my path in life, and it all began with the simple decision to chronicle my recipes online.
            
            As a self-taught baker myself, Eat' Cupcakes has become a trusted resource for fellow dessert lovers who are also eager to bake from scratch. On my blog, you’ll find hundreds of from-scratch recipes that are inspired by seasonal favorites and recipes that have been passed down to me. There are also plenty of helpful kitchen tips, lessons on baking basics, step-by-step photos, and video tutorials that will encourage you to grow and have confidence in the kitchen.
            
            I’m fiercely dedicated to providing well-tested recipes and sharing everything I’ve learned along the way. Before I post a new recipe, you can feel confident that I have already tested it dozens of times in my own kitchen. I truly hope Eat' Cupcakes will be your first stop when you need a recipe for any occasion—whether it’s a killer dessert for Thanksgiving, a tempting Valentine’s Day treat for your love, or just some delicious comfort cookies after a tough week. I’m thankful you’re here to join the baking adventure!</font></p>
      
            <h6 class="display-6"><font color="purple">A small History about Cupcakes</font>
            </h6>
            <p><font size="3">The earliest extant description of what is now often called a cupcake was in 1796, when a recipe for "a light cake to bake in small cups" was written in American Cookery by Amelia Simmons. The earliest extant documentation of the term cupcake itself was in "Seventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats" in 1828 in Eliza Leslie's Receipts cookbook.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">In the early 19th century, there were two different uses for the term cup cake or cupcake. In previous centuries, before muffin tins were widely available, the cakes were often baked in individual pottery cups, ramekins, or molds and took their name from the cups they were baked in. This is the use of the name that has remained, and the name of "cupcake" is now given to any small, round cake that is about the size of a teacup. While English fairy cakes vary in size more than American cupcake, they are traditionally smaller and are rarely topped with elaborate icing.
            </font></p>
            <p><font size="3">The other kind of "cup cake" referred to a cake whose ingredients were measured by volume, using a standard-sized cup, instead of being weighed. Recipes whose ingredients were measured using a standard-sized cup could also be baked in cups; however, they were more commonly baked in tins as layers or loaves. In later years, when the use of volume measurements was firmly established in home kitchens, these recipes became known as 1234 cakes or quarter cakes, so called because they are made up of four ingredients: one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, three cups of flour, and four eggs. They are plain yellow cakes, somewhat less rich and less expensive than pound cake, due to using about half as much butter and eggs compared to pound cake.
            </font></p>
            <p><font size="3">The names of these two major classes of cakes were intended to signal the method to the baker; "cup cake" uses a volume measurement, and "pound cake" uses a weight measurement.</font></p>
